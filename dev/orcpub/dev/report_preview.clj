(ns orcpub.dev.report-preview
  "Dev tool: preview the character-load report email WITHOUT sending it.

   The front-end input guards make the report path hard to exercise through the
   UI, and you don't want to blast a real inbox to test it. This renders the exact
   message orcpub.email/send-character-report would compose, plus the would-it-send
   gate, for a set of canned scenarios — so recipient, subject, body, how much of
   the character data is exposed, header-injection risk, and the config/throttle
   gates are all inspectable at a glance.
