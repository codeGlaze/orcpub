  "B4 drift guard: prove the invariant `save ⊆ load` for every homebrew content
   type — anything a SAVE spec accepts, the LOOSE LOAD floor must also accept.

   Why it matters: save and load validate independently. If the load floor ever
   grows stricter than a save spec (someone 'tightens validation on import'), then
   content that saved fine would be QUARANTINED on the next boot — a data-loss-
   adjacent surprise. This test goes red the moment that subset relation breaks,
   so the loose-load backward-compat guarantee can't silently erode.

   It also pins the registry itself: every content type with a save handler is in
   `content-specs/save-specs` exactly once, and each entry names a real spec."
