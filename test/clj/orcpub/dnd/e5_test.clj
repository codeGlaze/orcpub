;; ---- resilient-loader real-content guard (folded from plugin-load-test) ----
;; The loader quarantines a source only if it fails ::e5/plugin. The danger is
;; FALSE quarantine — a source real users rely on getting dropped on load. These
;; push actual .orcbrew fixtures (test/fixtures/) through the same salvage
;; decision the loader uses: valid content kept in full, only broken content
;; isolated. Fixtures are asserted to EXIST so a missing one fails loudly.
;;
;; test-pak.orcbrew is a large (~760KB) multi-source pak whose content has been
;; replaced with public-domain filler — no copyrighted names. It's the everyday-
;; content guard: every valid source must be kept, none falsely quarantined.

;; The exact predicate the resilient loader injects into salvage-plugins — one
;; shared definition of "loadable", not a copy — so this real-content guard proves
;; the loader's actual accept/quarantine decision, not a look-alike.
