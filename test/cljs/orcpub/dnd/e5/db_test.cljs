  "Storage-layer tests for the resilient loader's read path (db.cljs).

   B2.0/F5: `get-local-storage-item` used to DELETE any key whose contents
   wouldn't parse. For the homebrew slots (plugins + its quarantine
   companion) that destroyed data the loader was supposed to preserve — a
   truncated or quota-cut blob was gone before anything could rescue it. These
   tests pin the new behavior: unreadable homebrew is moved to a ':corrupt' slot
   and the active slot cleared (never destroyed), while non-homebrew slots keep
   the old remove-on-unreadable behavior.

   Requires a real localStorage — runs in the headless chromium cljs suite."
