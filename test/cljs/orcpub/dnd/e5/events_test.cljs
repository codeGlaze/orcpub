(ns orcpub.dnd.e5.events-test
  "Integration tests for re-frame event handlers refactored during the
   subscribe-outside-reactive-context fix. These tests verify that
   dispatching an event produces the expected db state or effects.

   PATTERN — testing a reg-event-db handler:
     1. Reset app-db to a known state
     2. dispatch-sync the event
     3. Assert on @app-db

   PATTERN — testing a reg-event-fx handler:
     For handlers that return {:http ...} or {:dispatch ...}, we can't
     easily capture effects without day8.re-frame/re-frame-test. Instead:
     - Test the db-only portions via dispatch-sync
     - For effects, test indirectly (e.g. verify db guard logic)
     - Or register a stub :http fx handler before the test

   NOTE: These tests require all event handlers to be registered. We do
   this by requiring orcpub.dnd.e5.events, which has side effects
   (reg-event-db, reg-event-fx calls at load time)."

;; Stress harness reproducing the emergent "repetitive clicking -> malformed data
;; (nil instead of false)" corruption by driving the REAL toggle event handlers in
;; the REAL cljs runtime.
;;
;; FINDINGS (reproduced here):
;; 1. Leaf flag toggles are nil-clean but leave FALSE-CRUFT: toggling a skill on
;;    then off leaves `:athletics false` (never removed) — it exports forever.
;; 2. The "nil instead of false" is a PARENT-PATH collapse: a boolean toggle whose
;;    path lands on a MAP applies `(not map)` = false, nuking the whole map. Then
;;    every per-key READ under that node returns nil (`(get false :k)` = nil) and
;;    the next child toggle does `(assoc false …)` which THROWS in cljs.
;;
;; STATUS: FIXED — content-prop toggles use common/toggle-flag (not bare `not`),
;; which refuses to collapse a map; these assert the fixed behavior. The false-cruft
;; is a SEPARATE issue (export cleanup); leaf-toggle-hammer-no-nil still documents it.
;; Legacy data already collapsed to `false` self-heals on the next child toggle.
