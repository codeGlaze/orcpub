  "Single source of truth tying SAVE and LOAD validation together: each homebrew
   content-type keyword → its STRICT per-type save spec, plus the LOOSE floor
   every saved item must still satisfy on load.

   Save and load used to name their specs independently, so they could DRIFT: if
   load ever grew stricter than save, already-saved content would be quarantined
   on the next boot. One generative test (`content_specs_test`) proves the
   invariant `save ⊆ load` — anything a save spec accepts, the load floor accepts.

   LOAD stays deliberately loose (`:option-pack` string + letter-leading key, see
   `::e5/homebrew-item`) for backward compat: never reject real saved content just
   because a builder's save spec later tightened."
